# Code Implementation Guidelines

## Core Practices

- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, `const toggle = () => { }`. Also, define a type if possible.
- Fully implement all requested functionality with no placeholders or TODOs.

## Naming Conventions

- Event functions should be named with a "handle" prefix:
  - `handleClick` for onClick
  - `handleKeyDown` for onKeyDown
  - `handleSubmit` for onSubmit
  - Follow this pattern consistently

## Code Organization

- Include all required imports at the top of files.
- Ensure proper naming of key components.
- Follow DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- Write bug-free, fully functional and working code.

## Import Conventions

- Import shadcn/ui components from `@/components/ui/*`:
  ```typescript
  import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
  import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card"
  ```
- Import custom components from `@/components/*`
- Import custom hooks from `@/hooks/*`
- Import utilities from `@/lib/utils`
- Group imports: React/Next, third-party, UI components, custom components, hooks, utilities
